= Getting Started With the CLI Utility

== Installation

Install the `opennms` project globally, using https://www.npmjs.com/[npm].

1. install https://nodejs.org/en/download/[Node.js] (Node.js comes with `npm`)
2. run `npm install -g opennms`
3. run `opennms --help` for a list of available commands

== Configuration

Before you can query your OpenNMS server, you must first configure the command-line tool to know where to find it.

Run:

[source, shell]
----
opennms connect --username <your-username> --password <your-password> https://your-opennms-server/opennms
----

This will store a configuration file that the `opennms` command will read automatically when you run it.
